# Graphical-Representation-of-Alpha-Decay
A very basic, terrible animation on graphically showing how alpha decay (using a natural exponential decay function), can impact a trading strategy's equity curve compared to it's benchmark.  

Required dependencies:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas

1. the program when ran asks for a series of inputs, if unsure of idiosyncratic noise it is as follows:
   - idiosyncratic noise refers to random price movements within a specific security or asset that are not explained by overall market or industry trends but are instead caused by factors unique to that company, adding a layer of unpredictability to an already stochasticly behaving time series.
2. the random seed may be left blank

   DISCLAIMER:
   THIS PROJECT WAS CREATED USING AI TOOLS. THIS IS NOT MY ENTIRE WORK, ONLY THE IDEA IS MINE, THE CODE IS ENTIRELY DONE BY VARIOUS AI LLMs SUCH AS CLAUDE, GPT-5, ETC.
   I AM STILL LEARNING PYTHON SO BEAR WITH THE SHITTY ANIMATION AND CODE. :)
